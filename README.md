IX Member List JSON Schema
===========

A JSON schema for IXP member lists 

## About 
Most IXPâ€™s enable their members to fetch a list of the connected members in various formats. The Euro-IX community is working on a portable JSON output format for member lists on IXP websites.

## Location
It is suggested to locate the REST call under a well defined URI on the IXP's website, or use standard HTTP redirects (3xx). We recommend the locatin: http://www.example.com/participants.json

## Documentation
More detailed documentation is available on the [github wiki page](https://github.com/euro-ix/json-schemas/wiki).
