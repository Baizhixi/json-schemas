IX Member List JSON Schema
===========

A JSON schema for IXP member lists 

## About 
Most IXPâ€™s enable their members to fetch a list of the connected members in various formats. The Euro-IX community is working on a portable JSON output format for member lists on IXP websites.

## Location
It is advised to locate or redirect the REST call under a well defined URL on the IXP's website. We recommend http://ixp-base.url/participants.json

## Documentation
More detailed documentation is available on the [github wiki page](https://github.com/euro-ix/json-schemas/wiki).
